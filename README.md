The code is designed to run on a parallel system with multiple processes. Each component (Coupler, PA, PB, PC) is executed by a separate process, and communication between the processes is achieved using MPI (Message Passing Interface).
The Coupler component is responsible for managing the overall workflow and communication between PA, PB, and PC. It sends and receives messages to coordinate the exchange of data and perform work.
PA, PB, and PC are separate components that perform their specific tasks. They communicate with the Coupler and exchange data with each other as needed.
The architecture follows a 2D decomposition, where the processes are organized in a 2D grid. PA, PB, and PC components are arranged in a 2D Cartesian communicator, allowing for easy communication within their rows and columns.
Overall, the architecture allows for distributed computation and coordination between different components using MPI.
Here's a breakdown of the architecture and communication pattern:

Coupler Program
The Coupler program acts as the central coordinator.
It splits the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator into a separate communicator (coupler_comm) for the coupler component.
The coupler receives the ranks of A, B, and C components.
It broadcasts the ranks of A and B to all processes.
It receives data (u_PA, u_PB, and u_PC) from A, B, and C components, respectively.
It broadcasts u_PA to B and C components.
It broadcasts u_PB to A and C components.
It broadcasts u_PC to A and B components.
A Program:
The A program performs computations specific to component A.
It splits the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator into a separate communicator (PA) for component A.
It receives the coupler and B ranks from the coupler.
It sends its rank and the number of its processes (PA_nprocs) to the coupler.
It gathers the ranks of all A processes into PA_plist on the root process (rank 0) of the PA communicator.
It sends the PA_plist and its own rank to the coupler.
It receives u_B from B component and performs computations.
It sends u_PA to the coupler.
The A program repeats its computations in a loop for a specified number of iterations (nstep_PA).
B Program:
The B program performs computations specific to component B.
It follows a similar pattern as program A.
It splits the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator into a separate communicator (PB) for component B.
It receives the coupler, A, and C ranks from the coupler.
It sends its rank and the number of its processes (PB_nprocs) to the coupler.
It gathers the ranks of all B processes into PB_plist on the root process (rank 0) of the PB communicator.
It sends the PB_plist to the coupler.
It receives u_A from A component, performs computations, and sends u_PB to the coupler.
It receives u_C from C component and repeats its computations in a loop (nstep_PB).
C Program:
The C program performs computations specific to component C.
It follows a similar pattern as programs A and B.
It splits the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator into a separate communicator (PC) for component C.
It receives the coupler and B ranks from the coupler.
It sends its rank and the number of its processes (PC_nprocs) to the coupler.
It gathers the ranks of all C processes into PC_plist on the root process (rank 0) of the PC communicator.
It sends the PC_plist to the coupler.
It receives u_B from B component, performs computations, and sends u_PC to the coupler.
It repeats its computations in a loop (nstep_PC).
The communication pattern involves point-to-point communication using MPI_Send and MPI_Recv functions between the components and the coupler. The components send their ranks and receive ranks from the coupler, exchange data with each other, and send the computed data to the coupler.

B Program:
The B program performs a 2D decomposition by creating a Cartesian communicator (cart_comm) using the MPI_CART_CREATE function.
The Cartesian communicator is based on the original MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator and creates a 2D grid structure.
The grid dimensions are determined based on the number of processes in the B component (PB_nprocs) and the desired number of rows (num_rows).
Each process is assigned a unique Cartesian coordinate (cart_coords) within the grid.
The Cartesian communicator is split into row communicators (row_comm) and column communicators (col_comm) using the MPI_CART_SUB function.
The row rank (row_rank) and column rank (col_rank) are determined within their respective communicators.
Communication with A Component:
B component receives u_A from the A component using MPI_RECV.
The communication involves point-to-point communication between B and A ranks (coordinated by the coupler).
No specific integration of the 2D decomposition is observed in the communication with A.
Communication with C Component:
B component receives u_C from the C component using MPI_RECV.
The communication involves point-to-point communication between B and C ranks (coordinated by the coupler).
No specific integration of the 2D decomposition is observed in the communication with C.
Communication within B Component:
B component performs data exchange among its processes within the 2D decomposition grid structure.
The 2D decomposition enables efficient data exchange based on the row and column structure.
MPI_GATHER and MPI_SEND are used to gather and send data between B processes within the column communicator (col_comm).
The gathered data is then sent to the coupler.
The 2D decomposition in B component allows for better coordination and communication within the component itself. The row and column structure enables efficient data exchange among the B processes, reducing the amount of data sent and improving performance.
It's important to note that the integration of the 2D decomposition is specific to the B component and its internal communication. The communication with other components (A and C) is not directly affected by the 2D decomposition and follows the point-to-point communication pattern coordinated by the coupler component.
